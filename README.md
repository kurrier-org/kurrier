Kurrier is a modern, self-hosted webmail built for people who don't want the hassle to run their own email stack, yet want control over their data and privacy and ability to connect and manage multiple providers and email identities.
It connects to standard protocols and providers — IMAP, SMTP, SES, SendGrid, Mailgun, and more — giving you a single, fast interface to turn any email service provider into a full-featured webmail.



## Why Kurrier?

Kurrier is designed as a next-generation alternative to traditional webmail — minimal, extensible, and ready for modern infrastructure:

- **Connect any provider** — IMAP, SMTP, SES, SendGrid, Mailgun, or custom gateways.
- **Unified web interface** — consistent, responsive, and designed for multiple identities.
- **Self-hosted first** — privacy by design, no external dependencies or data sharing.
- **Modern backend** — built with the latest Nextjs/TS/Nitro stack that makes integrations and automation easy.
- **Developer-friendly** — clean JSON structures, delta sync, and extensible plugin logic.
- **Docker-ready** — deploy easily on your own server, VPS, or container stack.

Kurrier aims to give you the simplicity of a webmail with the flexibility of a full-featured mail gateway — all under your control.
