# SMTP / IMAP

Kurrier supports connecting to any standard **SMTP** and **IMAP** server — letting you send and receive emails through your own mail host.

This option is perfect if you already have an email account with a provider such as Gmail (App Password), Outlook, Zoho, Proton, or a custom domain managed through cPanel or another hosting provider.

---

## 1. Overview

When you add an SMTP/IMAP account in Kurrier, two connections are created:

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** — used to **send** emails
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** — used to **receive** and sync incoming emails

You can configure only SMTP (for outbound mail) or both SMTP + IMAP (for full two-way sync).

---

## 2. Adding Your Account

In Kurrier, go to:

> **Dashboard → Providers → Add Provider → SMTP/IMAP**

You’ll see the following fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Account Label** | A friendly name for this connection | `Work Email` |
| **SMTP Host** | Outgoing mail server hostname | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| **SMTP Port** | Usually `465` for SSL or `587` for STARTTLS | `587` |
| **SMTP Username** | Your full email address or username | `you@yourdomain.com` |
| **SMTP Password** | App password or login password | `********` |
| **SMTP Secure** | Choose `TRUE` for SSL/TLS | `TRUE` |
| **SMTP Pool** | Optional — leave `FALSE` unless you know you need pooled connections | `FALSE` |
| **IMAP Host** | Incoming mail server (optional) | `imap.gmail.com` |
| **IMAP Port** | Usually `993` for SSL | `993` |
| **IMAP Username** | Your full email address or username | `you@yourdomain.com` |
| **IMAP Password** | Password or app password | `********` |
| **IMAP Secure** | Choose `TRUE` for SSL/TLS | `TRUE` |

## 3. Example Configurations

### Gmail (App Password)
> ⚠️ Requires [2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| SMTP Host | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| SMTP Port | `465` (SSL) |
| SMTP Secure | `TRUE` |
| IMAP Host | `imap.gmail.com` |
| IMAP Port | `993` (SSL) |
| IMAP Secure | `TRUE` |

Use your Gmail address for both username fields and the 16-character app password for both passwords.

---

### Outlook / Office 365
| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| SMTP Host | `smtp.office365.com` |
| SMTP Port | `587` (STARTTLS) |
| SMTP Secure | `TRUE` |
| IMAP Host | `outlook.office365.com` |
| IMAP Port | `993` |
| IMAP Secure | `TRUE` |

Username is usually your full email address.

---

### cPanel / Custom Domain
| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| SMTP Host | `mail.yourdomain.com` |
| SMTP Port | `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS) |
| IMAP Host | `mail.yourdomain.com` |
| IMAP Port | `993` |
| Secure | `TRUE` for both |

Contact your web host if you’re unsure of these values.

---

## 4. Security Options

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **SMTP Secure** | Enables SSL/TLS encryption for outgoing mail. Set to `TRUE` unless your server requires plain STARTTLS. |
| **SMTP Pool** | Allows reusing SMTP connections for faster bulk sending. Leave `FALSE` unless you’re running large workloads. |
| **IMAP Secure** | Enables SSL/TLS encryption for incoming mail. Always set to `TRUE` unless debugging local servers. |

---

## 5. Verification & Troubleshooting

Once you click **Save**, Kurrier will test your connection automatically.

### ✅ Success
You’ll see a **Verified** badge next to your new provider.

### ⚠️ Common Errors

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `Invalid login or password` | Wrong credentials or app password | Double-check username/password |
| `Connection refused` | Wrong port or SSL setting | Try switching `SMTP Secure` or check your host’s SSL port |
| `IMAP timeout` | IMAP disabled on the account | Enable IMAP (e.g. in Gmail settings) |
| `Hostname mismatch` | Wrong IMAP/SMTP hostname | Use provider’s documented host name |

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use **App Passwords** when available — never your real login password.
- Always use **secure ports** (`465`/`993`) with SSL.
- Avoid shared or root email credentials.
- For hosted domains, create dedicated mailbox users for Kurrier.

## 7. Notes for Self-Hosted Mail Servers

If you’re connecting to your own mail server (e.g., Postfix/Dovecot):

1. Ensure **`smtpd_tls_security_level = may`** or higher in Postfix.
2. IMAP must listen on port `993` with `ssl = yes`.
3. You may need to allow Kurrier’s IP or internal Docker network.

**Tip:** You can create multiple SMTP/IMAP accounts in Kurrier — one for each mailbox or domain you manage.
