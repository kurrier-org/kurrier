# Mailgun

Mailgun is a reliable email delivery service used for transactional and marketing emails.
Kurrier can connect directly to your Mailgun account via its **API key** for sending and receiving emails.

## 1. Overview

When you integrate Mailgun with Kurrier, the app uses Mailgunâ€™s REST API for sending emails and optional inbound routing.
Setup takes just one step â€” adding your Mailgun API key.

## 2. Adding Mailgun in Kurrier

In Kurrier, go to:

> **Dashboard â†’ Providers â†’ Add Provider â†’ Mailgun**

Youâ€™ll see a single required field:

| Field | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **MAILGUN_API_KEY** | Your private API key from the Mailgun dashboard | `key-9f6a41e71113d30cadeb28c-1ae02a08-07217cd` |

Click **Submit** to save your configuration.

Once saved, Kurrier will automatically verify the key and display a âœ… **Verified** status if successful.

## 3. Where to Find Your API Key
