# SendGrid

SendGrid is a popular transactional and marketing email platform by Twilio.
Kurrier integrates directly with SendGrid’s REST API to handle sending and tracking emails using a single API key.

---

## 1. Overview

Connecting SendGrid to Kurrier allows you to send emails through your SendGrid account without configuring SMTP.
You only need your **SendGrid API Key** — Kurrier will handle everything else via the SendGrid API.

---

## 2. Adding SendGrid in Kurrier

In Kurrier, go to:

> **Dashboard → Providers → Add Provider → SendGrid**

You’ll see the following field:

| Field | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **SENDGRID_API_KEY** | Your SendGrid API key (starts with `SG.`) | `SG.4aA4DyiCTValYwQQ.aC0RQSHrzdNeHFVMfIrgwn2RM3iVjkzIBNl` |

Click **Submit** to save.
Kurrier will automatically validate the key and show **✅ Verified** on success.

---

## 3. Where to Find Your API Key

1. Log in to your [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/).
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys**.
3. Click **Create API Key**.
4. Name your key (e.g., `Kurrier Integration`).
5. Under **API Key Permissions**, choose **Full Access** or **Restricted Access** (see below).
6. Copy the generated key and paste it into Kurrier’s form.

> ⚠️ You won’t be able to view this key again after closing the dialog, so store it securely.

---

## 4. Recommended Permissions

For Kurrier to send emails and verify the connection properly, your key must have at least the following permissions:

| Permission | Access Level | Description |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| `Mail Send` | Full Access | Required for sending outbound emails |
| `User Account` | Read Access | Used to validate the key and fetch account info |
| `Stats` | Read Access | Optional, for analytics or usage data |

> You can choose **Full Access** if you’re unsure — it will work without issues, but restricted keys are safer for production.

---

## 5. Verify the Connection

After saving your key, click **Verify Connection**.
Kurrier will attempt an authentication check with SendGrid’s API endpoint (`https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/user/account`).

### ✅ Success
You’ll see **Verified** next to your SendGrid provider.

### ⚠️ Failure
Check that:
- The API key is active and copied correctly.
- It has at least `Mail Send` permissions.
- Outbound HTTPS connections to `api.sendgrid.com` are allowed from your server.

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|----------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid API key or missing permissions | Recheck your key or create a new one |
| `403 Forbidden` | Domain or sender not verified | Verify your domain in SendGrid |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded | Slow down sending or request higher limits |
| `500 Server Error` | Temporary SendGrid issue | Retry after a few seconds |


---

**Tip:** SendGrid keys always start with `SG.` — if yours doesn’t, double-check that you copied the correct key from the dashboard.
