# Postmark

Postmark is a reliable transactional email service focused on fast delivery and excellent deliverability.
Kurrier connects directly to Postmark via its **Server Token** and **Account Token** for sending and managing outbound emails.

---

## 1. Overview

When you link Postmark to Kurrier, the app sends mail using Postmark’s REST API — no SMTP needed.
You just need two keys from your Postmark dashboard:

- **Server Token** — used to send emails from a specific Postmark Server
- **Account Token** — used for administrative operations

---

## 2. Adding Postmark in Kurrier

In Kurrier, go to:

> **Dashboard → Providers → Add Provider → Postmark**

Enter the following fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN** | Your Postmark server API token | `74ef518e-2dfa-451d-b9cf-2843608f789a` |
| **POSTMARK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN** | Your Postmark account-level token | `0762807c-08e9-4ac3-a872-25e635766g61` |

Click **Submit** to save your configuration.
Kurrier will automatically validate the credentials and show **✅ Verified** when successful.

---

## 3. Where to Find Your Tokens

1. Log in to your [Postmark Dashboard](https://account.postmarkapp.com/).
2. Navigate to **Servers → (Choose your Server)**.
3. Under **API Tokens**, copy the **Server API Token** — this identifies that specific sending server.
4. For the **Account Token**, go to **Account → API Tokens** and copy your account-level token (used for broader account access).


---

## 4. Verify the Connection

After saving, click **Verify Connection** in the Postmark card.
Kurrier will test connectivity by making a simple authentication request to the Postmark API.

- ✅ **Success:** You’ll see a verified badge next to your Postmark provider.
- ⚠️ **Failure:** Check that both tokens are valid and belong to the same Postmark account.

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|----------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or expired API token | Re-copy your tokens and re-save |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Domain or sender not verified | Verify your domain or sender in Postmark |
| `403 Forbidden` | Using account token where server token is required | Ensure the **Server Token** is set correctly |
| `Timeout` | Network/firewall issue | Allow outbound HTTPS to `api.postmarkapp.com` |


---

**Tip:** Kurrier integrates Postmark natively via the official API — no SMTP setup required.
