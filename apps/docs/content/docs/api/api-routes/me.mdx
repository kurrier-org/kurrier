# GET /me

The `/me` endpoint allows you to validate your API key and retrieve basic information about the authenticated user (the owner of the API key).
This is useful for testing API key validity and discovering the `ownerId` tied to the key.

For more details on authentication, see the [authentication guide](/docs/api/authentication).
