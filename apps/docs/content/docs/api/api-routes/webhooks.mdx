title: Webhooks
description: Receive incoming webhooks through Kurrier's unified API
---

Kurrier lets you **register outbound webhooks** so your app can react to events like
messages being sent, delivered, bounced, or received.

These endpoints are **management APIs** – you call them from your backend with your
Kurrier API key. For more information on authentication, see the
[authentication guide](/docs/api/authentication).

All routes below are relative to:

```text
https://your-domain.com/api/kurrier
```

---

## Event types

Right now Kurrier plans supports the following event names (this list may grow over time):

- `message.received`

and these are coming soon:

- `message.sent`
- `message.delivered`
- `message.bounced`

Please open an issue on Github if you have other event types you'd like to see.

You subscribe a webhook to one or more of these events using the `events` field.
