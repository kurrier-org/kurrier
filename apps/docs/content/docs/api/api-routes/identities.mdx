title: Identities
description: Manage email identities in Kurrier
---

Identities represent **email addresses or domains** that you have connected to Kurrier.
Each identity can optionally belong to a provider (SES, SMTP, Mailgun, etc.) and is
used when sending or receiving email.

These endpoints let you **create, list, update, and delete identities** from your
backend using your Kurrier API key.

All routes below are relative to:

```text
https://your-domain.com/api/kurrier
```

## What is an Identity?

An identity is either:

- an **email identity** (`email@example.com`)
- a **domain identity** (`example.com`)

Identities also store DNS verification records, provider configuration,
status, and metadata.

---

## List identities

### `GET /identities`

Returns all identities owned by the authenticated user.

---

## Get a single identity

### `GET /identities/{id}`

Fetch an identity by its ID.

---

## Update an identity

### `PATCH /identities/{id}`

Partially update an identity.

---

## Delete an identity

### `DELETE /identities/{id}`

Permanently deletes an identity.

Note: This cascades to mailboxes and worker sync state.
