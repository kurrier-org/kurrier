Kurrier exposes a single, focused endpoint for sending email.

For more information on how to authenticate with the Kurrier API, see the [authentication guide](/docs/api/authentication).


### POST /email/send


| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **identityId** *(required)* | The Kurrier Identity to send from | `"id_12345"` |
| **to** *(required)* | One recipient email addresses | `"ada@example.com"` |
| **subject** *(required)* | Subject line of the email | `"Welcome to Kurrier!"` |
| **html** *(required unless `text` is provided)* | HTML version of the email body | `"<p>Hello!</p>"` |
| **text** *(required unless `html` is provided)* | Plain-text version of the email body | `"Hello!"` |
| **cc** | CC recipients | `"manager@your.co,ops@your.co"` |

Send an email using one of your configured Identities (which in turn map to a provider account such as SES, SMTP, Mailgun, Postmark, SendGrid, etc.).
