description: How to access the Kurrier API

## Overview

Kurrier exposes a simple HTTP+JSON API for sending email and managing webhooks to receive emails from various providers.

All endpoints are **authenticated** and live under the Kurrier namespace:

```text
https://your-domain.com/api/kurrier
```

The API is currently v1 and versioning is handled via your API key. You can generate and manage API keys in the Kurrier dashboard

### Steps

1. Go to **API Keys**
2. Add a key with a name and optional restrictions. Note, the default scopes allow everything for now and will be refined in the future.

### Authentication

Every request must include your API key. Kurrier supports bearer token authentication via the `Authorization` header.:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
