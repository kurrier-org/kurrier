Once Kurrier is up and running, you can start exploring the web dashboard and connecting your email providers.

---

## 📨 Configure Your First Provider

Kurrier supports multiple email providers out of the box.
You can verify and connect them from **Settings → Providers** in the dashboard.

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Navigate to **Settings → Providers**
3. Choose a provider —
[Mailgun](/docs/providers/mailgun),
[Postmark](/docs/providers/postmark),
[SendGrid](/docs/providers/sendgrid),
[AWS SES](/docs/providers/ses),
or [SMTP/IMAP](/docs/providers/smtp)
4. Enter your credentials or domain details
5. Kurrier will automatically create the necessary configurations to send and receive emails through that provider

Once your provider is connected, you can start creating **email** and **domain identities** under the **Identities** section.
These identities are linked to your provider and enable sending and receiving mail through Kurrier including accessing a webmail for each email.

---

## 🗂️ Add an Identity

An **identity** in Kurrier can be either a **domain** or an **email address**.
To keep things consistent across providers, you’ll first add and verify a **domain**, then create email identities under it.

For example, if you add `mydomain.com`, you can later create emails like
`support@mydomain.com`, `tim@mydomain.com`, or `martha@mydomain.com`.

Once verified, each email identity gets its own webmail dashboard.

---

### Steps

1. Go to **Identities → Add Domain**
2. Choose a verified provider (e.g., Mailgun, SES, SMTP)
3. Kurrier will display the required **DNS records** — add them to your DNS host
4. Click **Verify Domain** once the records are live
5. After verification, create email identities like `support@mydomain.com`

## 📬 Sending a Test Email

You can send test emails to check if the email identities are working as expected by pressing the send test email button besides each email identity.

---

## 🔄 Background Sync

Kurrier continuously syncs mailboxes and processes inbound mail.
The background service (Nitro Worker) handles:

- IMAP message polling and connection persistence
- Webhook setup and processing
- Delivery retries
- Attachments indexing

> 🧠 You can monitor the worker logs using:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose logs -f worker
> ```
