description: How to install and run Kurrier on your own server.
---

Kurrier can be self-hosted on any modern Linux, macOS, or ARM device (including Raspberry Pi).
It‚Äôs distributed as a Docker setup for convenience, but you can also run it manually from source if you prefer.

> üß± **Kurrier‚Äôs core stack:**
> Next.js + Nitro (API worker) + Postgres + Redis + IMAP/SMTP connectors

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
‚Üí [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **At least 1 GB RAM** and **1 vCPU**  (2 GB+ recommended for production)
- Optional: a domain name (for `mail.yourdomain.com` or similar)

---

## Quick start (Docker)

Clone the repository and copy the example environment file:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kurrier-org/kurrier.git
cd kurrier/db
cp example.env .env
cp -r ./init/volumes/ volumes
```

Open the .env file and update your secrets and passwords. You can also use the built-in secrets generator below to create a secure, production-ready passwords and secrets.

```bash
REDIS_PASSWORD=replace_with_your_redis_password
RLS_CLIENT_PASSWORD=replace_with_your_rls_client_password
TYPESENSE_API_KEY=supersecretkey
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long
ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyAgCiAgICAicm9sZSI6ICJhbm9uIiwKICAgICJpc3MiOiAic3VwYWJhc2UtZGVtbyIsCiAgICAiaWF0IjogMTY0MTc2OTIwMCwKICAgICJleHAiOiAxNzk5NTM1NjAwCn0.dc_X5iR_VP_qT0zsiyj_I_OZ2T9FtRU2BBNWN8Bu4GE

```

### üîê Generate Secrets Automatically

If you don‚Äôt want to manually craft all the passwords and JWT keys, you can generate them instantly using the built-in generator below.
It creates a secure, production-ready .env block with everything filled in ‚Äî including the compatible JWT keys.

## üß© Local vs. Hosted Setup

Kurrier can run in **two modes** ‚Äî local and hosted (on a VPS etc with a domain name).
Both work the same way, but differ in how external services like **AWS SES**, **SendGrid**, or **Mailgun** can reach your server.

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Setup

If you‚Äôre running Kurrier on your own laptop or private machine (http://localhost or internal IP),
email providers can‚Äôt reach your API directly to deliver incoming messages or webhooks.

To solve this, Kurrier allows you to define your own public tunnel URL via any tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started), [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/), or [LocalTunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).

Example using ngrok:

```bash
  ngrok http 3001
```

You can also use any other tunneling service of your choice.

Update your `.env` file with the generated public URL:

```bash
LOCAL_TUNNEL_URL=https://your-ngrok-tunnel-url.ngrok-free.app
```

<Callout type="warning">
    We highly recommend hosting Kurrier on a public server with a domain for production use as tunnels might not be reliable for production workloads
    and any downtime or change in the tunnel URL will break incoming email delivery and webhooks.
</Callout>


### üñ•Ô∏è Hosted Setup

When hosting Kurrier on a server or cloud instance (e.g. DigitalOcean, AWS, Hetzner, or your own VPS),
you should use your own domain and disable tunneling by removing or commenting out the `LOCAL_TUNNEL_URL` variable in your `.env` file.

```bash
WEB_URL=https://www.yourdomain.com // just an example
NITRO_URL=https://worker.yourdomain.com // just an example
```

---

‚úÖ Once you are all set with your environment variables you are now ready to run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

‚úÖ To stop Kurrier, run

```bash
docker compose down
```

### üß≠ Access the Dashboards

Once Docker finishes starting up, open the following URLs in your browser:

| Service | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Kurrier Web Dashboard** | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | Manage your mailboxes, messages, and settings |
| **Studio** | [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) | View and manage the Postgres database |
| **Nitro Worker (API)** | [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) | API background service and job runner |


<Callout type="info">
    To access Kurrier dashboard, signup and create your user account on http://localhost:3000
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    To access Studio, log in with the credentials you defined in your `.env` file DASHBOARD_USERNAME
    and DASHBOARD_PASSWORD
</Callout>
