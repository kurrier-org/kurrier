description: How to install and run Kurrier on your own server.
---

Kurrier can be self-hosted on any modern Linux, macOS, or ARM device (including Raspberry Pi).
It‚Äôs distributed as a Docker setup for convenience, but you can also run it manually from source if you prefer.

> üß± **Kurrier‚Äôs core stack:**
> Next.js + Nitro (API worker) + Postgres + Redis + IMAP/SMTP connectors

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
‚Üí [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **At least 1 GB RAM** and **1 vCPU**  (2 GB+ recommended for production)
- Optional: a domain name (for `mail.yourdomain.com` or similar)

---

## Quick start (Docker)

Clone the repository and copy the example environment file:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kurrier-org/kurrier.git
cd kurrier/db
cp example.env .env
cp -r ./init/volumes/ volumes
```

Open the .env file and update your secrets and passwords. You can also use the built-in secrets generator below to create a secure, production-ready passwords and secrets.

```bash
REDIS_PASSWORD=replace_with_your_redis_password
RLS_CLIENT_PASSWORD=replace_with_your_rls_client_password
TYPESENSE_API_KEY=supersecretkey
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long
ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyAgCiAgICAicm9sZSI6ICJhbm9uIiwKICAgICJpc3MiOiAic3VwYWJhc2UtZGVtbyIsCiAgICAiaWF0IjogMTY0MTc2OTIwMCwKICAgICJleHAiOiAxNzk5NTM1NjAwCn0.dc_X5iR_VP_qT0zsiyj_I_OZ2T9FtRU2BBNWN8Bu4GE

```

### üîê Generate Secrets Automatically

If you don‚Äôt want to manually craft all the passwords and JWT keys, you can generate them instantly using the built-in generator below.
It creates a secure, production-ready .env block with everything filled in ‚Äî including the compatible JWT keys.

## üß© Local vs. Hosted Setup

Kurrier can run in **two modes** ‚Äî local and hosted (on a VPS etc with a domain name).
Both work the same way, but differ in how external services like **AWS SES**, **SendGrid**, or **Mailgun** can reach your server.

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Setup

If you‚Äôre running Kurrier on your own laptop or a private machine (with `http://localhost` or an internal IP),
email providers can‚Äôt reach your API directly to deliver incoming messages or webhooks.

To make this seamless, Kurrier automatically starts a **LocalTunnel** connection by default using the `ENABLE_LOCAL_TUNNEL` flag in your `.env` file.:

```bash
ENABLE_LOCAL_TUNNEL=true
```

This creates a public URL (like `https://random-subdomain.loca.lt`) that tunnels requests to your local machine.
In case you want to host Kurrier on a public server, eg ```yourdomain.com```, you can disable this feature by setting the flag to `false`.

<Callout type="info">
    We highly recommend hosting Kurrier on a public server with a domain for production use, as LocalTunnel is not reliable for production workloads.
</Callout>


‚úÖ Once you are all set with your environment vars run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

‚úÖ To stop Kurrier, run

```bash
docker compose down
```


### üñ•Ô∏è Hosted Setup

When hosting Kurrier on a server or cloud instance (e.g. DigitalOcean, AWS, Hetzner, or your own VPS),
you should use your own domain and disable LocalTunnel:

```bash
ENABLE_LOCAL_TUNNEL=false
WEB_URL=https://www.yourdomain.com
```

    ‚úÖ Once you are all set with your environment vars run <code>docker compose up -d</code> anytime to start Kurrier
    and to stop Kurrier, run <code>docker compose down</code>

### üß≠ Access the Dashboards

Once Docker finishes starting up, open the following URLs in your browser:

| Service | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Kurrier Web Dashboard** | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | Manage your mailboxes, messages, and settings |
| **Studio** | [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) | View and manage the Postgres database |
| **Nitro Worker (API)** | [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) | API background service and job runner |


<Callout type="info">
    To access Kurrier dashboard, signup and create your user account on http://localhost:3000
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    To access Studio, log in with the credentials you defined in your `.env` file DASHBOARD_USERNAME
    and DASHBOARD_PASSWORD
</Callout>
