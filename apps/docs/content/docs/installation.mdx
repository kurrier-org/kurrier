description: How to install and run Kurrier on your own server.
---

Kurrier can be self-hosted on any modern Linux, macOS, or ARM device (including Raspberry Pi).
It‚Äôs distributed as a Docker setup for convenience, but you can also run it manually from source if you prefer.

> üß± **Kurrier‚Äôs core stack:**
> Next.js + Nitro (API worker) + Postgres + Redis + IMAP/SMTP connectors

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
‚Üí [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **At least 1 GB RAM** and **1 vCPU** for testing (2 GB+ recommended for production)
- Optional: a domain name (for `mail.yourdomain.com` or similar)

---

## Quick start (Docker)

Clone the repository and copy the example environment file:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kurrier-org/kurrier.git
cd kurrier/db
cp example.env .env
```

Open the .env file and set your environment variables:

```bash
WEB_PORT=3000
WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000
NITRO_PORT=3001

REDIS_PASSWORD=your-redis-password
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
RLS_CLIENT_PASSWORD=your-rls-password

TYPESENSE_API_KEY=supersecretkey
TYPESENSE_PORT=8108
TYPESENSE_PROTOCOL=http
TYPESENSE_HOST=typesense


POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-postgres-password
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
DASHBOARD_USERNAME=kurrier
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=kurrier
SECRET_KEY_BASE=your-secret-key-base
VAULT_ENC_KEY=your-encryption-key-32-chars-min
PG_META_CRYPTO_KEY=your-encryption-key-32-chars-min
```

### üîê Generate Secrets Automatically

If you don‚Äôt want to manually craft all the passwords and JWT keys, you can generate them instantly using the built-in generator below.
It creates a secure, production-ready .env block with everything filled in ‚Äî including the compatible JWT keys.

## üöÄ Start Kurrier

Once your `.env` file is ready, you can start all services with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will:
- Start Postgres, Redis, db services, and the Kurrier web interface.
- Run the initial database bootstrap.
- Expose the web UI and API worker locally.

At this point, Kurrier should be up and running! You are free to add your own proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) in front of it if you want to use a custom domain or HTTPS. If you want to use it locally, you can skip that step.
If you would like us to add a reverse proxy to the Docker setup, please open an issue or PR on GitHub.

<Card>
    ‚úÖ You can re-run <code>docker compose up -d</code> anytime to restart Kurrier after a system reboot.
</Card>

### üß≠ Access the Dashboards

| Service | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Kurrier Web Dashboard** | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | Manage your mailboxes, messages, and settings |

| **Nitro Worker (API)** | [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) | API background service and job runner |
