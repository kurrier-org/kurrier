title: What is Kurrier
description: Introduction to Kurrier and how to get your first instance running.

Kurrier is a modern, self-hosted workspace — a unified interface for **email, calendars, contacts and storage** — built for people who want the power and privacy of running their own stack without the complexity of maintaining one.

Kurrier connects directly to your existing providers using open standards:

- **Email:** IMAP / SMTP / SES / SendGrid / Mailgun / Postmark
- **Calendars:** CalDAV
- **Contacts:** CardDAV
- **Drive:** WebDAV/S3

This lets you bring **any provider**, any identity, and any domain into one fast, integrated interface — searchable, synced, and fully under your control.

Kurrier runs entirely on your own infrastructure, ensuring your mail, events, contacts, store, and credentials stay private.
It’s lightweight, API-first, cloud-ready, and designed to fit smoothly into personal setups, multi-domain environments, or fully custom workflows.

So whether you're looking for a simple unified workspace, a private Google like experience, or a way to manage multiple email identities across providers, **Kurrier gives you a complete, modern, extensible platform.**

## Why Kurrier?

Kurrier is built as a next-generation alternative to traditional webmail and PIM suites — minimal, extensible, and designed for modern infrastructure:

### ⭐ **Connect any provider**
Email (IMAP/SMTP/SES/etc.), Calendars (CalDAV), Contacts (CardDAV) — all in one place.

### ⭐ **Unified web interface**
A clean, consistent UI for email, events, and address books across multiple identities and domains.

### ⭐ **Self-hosted and private**
Your data never leaves your server. No analytics, no vendor lock-in, no dependency on third-party clouds.

### ⭐ **Modern backend**
Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Nitro — fast, modular, and ideal for automation or integration.

### ⭐ **Developer-friendly**
API-driven, event-driven, and structured around clean JSON models with predictable syncing logic.

### ⭐ **Docker-ready**
Deploy on a VPS, home server, container cluster, or anywhere you choose.

Kurrier combines the simplicity of a unified webmail with the robustness of a full personal-information backend — **all under your control**.
