description: A guide to upgrading Kurrier to the latest version.

Unless otherwise noted in the release notes, upgrading Kurrier is as simple as pulling the latest Docker images and restarting your services.

```bash
docker compose down
git pull origin main
docker compose up -d
```

There might be occasional new environment variables or configuration changes required for new versions. Always check the release notes for any additional steps needed during the upgrade process.

Any database migrations will be handled automatically during the startup process. For major version upgrades, it's recommended to back up your database before proceeding.

In case there are breaking changes, or changes that require manual intervention, these will be documented in the release notes and on this page.
In case you encounter any issues after upgrading, refer to the troubleshooting section in the documentation or seek help from the community.
