## What makes Kurrier Calendars special?

Kurrier isn’t just a standalone calendar server.
It’s part of a **deeply integrated personal information suite**, alongside:

### ✉️ **Mail**
Invite guests and receive event invitations **directly inside your Kurrier inbox**.
Kurrier automatically processes `.ics` attachments, updates your calendar, and tracks attendee responses.

### 👥 **Contacts (CardDAV)**
Your event attendees automatically link with your Kurrier contacts.
Names, avatars, and emails are unified across:

- Mail
- Contacts
- Calendar
- Autocomplete fields in the UI

No duplication. No inconsistencies. One shared identity graph.

### 📅 **Calendar**
Kurrier merges mail + contacts + events into a **single cohesive, self-hosted platform**.
