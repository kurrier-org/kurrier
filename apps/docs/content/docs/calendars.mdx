# Calendars (CalDAV)

Kurrier supports **full CalDAV calendar syncing**, so your events, reminders, invites, and schedules stay updated across all your devices — phones, tablets, and desktop apps.

Whether you use **Apple Calendar**, **Thunderbird**, **Outlook (with CalDAV plugins)**, or any CalDAV-compatible app, your calendar can stay in sync with your Kurrier instance.

## What works today

Kurrier’s backend is already fully capable of:

### ✅ Creating and storing calendars
You can add calendars (work, personal, shared, etc.) through any CalDAV-supported app.

### ✅ Syncing events
Any event you create or edit on your device syncs through Kurrier to all other connected devices.

### ✅ Recurring events
Daily, weekly, monthly events — everything is handled by the CalDAV server.

### ✅ Reminders, notes & metadata
Event notes, descriptions, time zones, alarms, and recurrence rules (RRULE) are all preserved.

### ✅ Multi-device support
Use Kurrier calendars on:

- iOS & macOS Calendar
- Thunderbird/Lightning
- Android (via DAVx⁵)
- Outlook (via CalDAV plugins)
- Any other CalDAV-compatible app

## Kurrier Calendar Web UI — coming soon

Right now, Kurrier’s calendar system is **fully functional**, but there is **no web management interface yet**.

You can already:

- Connect calendar apps
- Create/edit/delete events
- Sync events across devices

But the **Kurrier Calendar Web UI** (similar to Google Calendar) is under development.

It will let you:

- View your calendars in Day/Week/Month views
- Create and edit events directly in the browser
- Manage shared calendars
- Color-code calendars
- Search events
- View reminders & tasks
- See event details instantly
- Use drag-and-drop event editing

We are designing the UI with a **modern, clean, Google-Calendar-like layout**, fully integrated with the rest of Kurrier.

## Why CalDAV?

CalDAV is an **open standard** supported by many devices and apps.
Using Kurrier with CalDAV means:

- You keep full control of your data
- Your calendars sync without third-party servers
- You can migrate easily from other providers
- Your events stay portable across devices
- No vendor lock-in — ever

Kurrier simply acts as your **private, self-hosted calendar engine**.

## Connecting your device

Kurrier works with any CalDAV-compatible client. Refer to the contacts section for CardDAV setup, as the process is similar.
