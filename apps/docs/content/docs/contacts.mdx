# Contacts

Kurrier provides a **secure, private, cross‑platform address book** that works with
any device capable of CardDAV sync — including **iPhone, Android, Windows, macOS,
Linux**, and any app that supports open standards.

This page explains what contacts are in Kurrier, how syncing works, and what you
can expect when using Kurrier with different clients.

## What Kurrier Does

Kurrier gives you:

- **A central address book** stored in your self‑hosted Kurrier instance
- **Automatic syncing** with any device using the open CardDAV protocol
- **Zero vendor lock‑in** — move, export, or back up your data anytime
- **Full-featured contact management UI** inside the Kurrier dashboard
- **Instant back‑and‑forth sync** with your phone or computer
- **Label-based organisation** (Categories/Groups) preserved inside Kurrier
- **Photo support** — profile pictures sync both ways
- **Safe updates** — Kurrier never deletes or overwrites data unless you do

Kurrier works as the **source of truth**, while your devices act as CardDAV
clients.

## How Sync Works

Kurrier uses a standard CardDAV server internally. When your phone or laptop
connects to Kurrier:

1. The device asks for the list of contacts
2. Kurrier returns only what changed since the last sync
3. Devices send changes (add/update/delete) back to Kurrier
4. Kurrier updates its database
5. Your UI updates
6. The next sync cycle propagates changes to all other devices

This means:

- Sync is **incremental**, not full reload each time
- Multiple devices can update contacts independently
- Kurrier handles merging and updates safely
- Image updates, labels, notes, birthdays — all sync

---

## Supported Devices

Kurrier supports **any CardDAV-compatible client**, including:

### 📱 Mobile
- iPhone / iPad (iOS Contacts)
- Android Contacts apps supporting CardDAV
(DAVx⁵, OneCalendar, OpenSync, etc.)

### 💻 Desktop
- macOS Contacts
- Windows (via CardDAV-compatible apps)
- Linux KDE / GNOME (built-in CardDAV support)

### 🌐 Web & Open Protocol Tools
- Thunderbird (CardDAV built-in)
- Evolution
- Roundcube with CardDAV plugin
- Any tool that can read/write `.vcf` files

If your device supports CardDAV, Kurrier works with it.

## Labels (Categories / Groups)

Kurrier supports **contact labels**, which act like categories or groups.

In Kurrier they appear as:

- Color-coded labels
- Multiple per-contact
- Organizable and searchable

**Note:**
Some devices (like Apple Contacts) do not sync CardDAV categories reliably.
Kurrier still stores them internally, but the client may not show them.

---

## Photos

Kurrier fully supports:

- Device → Kurrier photo updates
- Kurrier → Device photo export
- Standard VCard base64 PHOTO fields
- Automatic MIME detection

Photo sync works across all major clients.

## How Kurrier Protects Your Data

- You host your own instance
- Your contact database lives on your own server
- All syncing uses standard, transparent protocols
- No analytics
- No third-party data storage

You always stay in control.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Contacts slow to appear?
Some clients (especially iOS/macOS) sync every few minutes, not instantly.

### Photos not showing?
Older CardDAV clients may have partial image support — Kurrier still stores them.

### Labels not visible on your device?
Many commercial clients ignore categories, even though Kurrier preserves them.
