This guide walks you through setting up the full development environment, including:

- ✔ Backend stack (Postgres, Supabase services, Redis, Typesense, Worker)
- ✔ Web dashboard (Next.js)
- ✔ Tools such as Studio & Kong

If you run into any issues, feel free to open an issue or PR — contributions of all kinds are welcome.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Kurrier uses **Docker Compose** . Start by ensuring you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


### 🛠️ Development Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kurrier-org/kurrier.git
cd kurrier/db
cp example.develop.env .env
cp example.develop.env .env.develop
cp -rn init/* .
docker compose up -d
cd ..
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

### Branching Strategy
We use the following branching strategy to manage our codebase:
- **main**: The main branch contains the stable and production-ready code. All new features and bug fixes are merged into this branch after testing.
- **develop**: The develop branch is where the latest development changes are integrated. This branch serves as a staging area for new features before they are merged into the main branch.

### 🧭 Access the Dashboards

Once Docker finishes starting up, open the following URLs in your browser:

| Service | URL | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Kurrier Web Dashboard** | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | Manage your mailboxes, messages, and settings |
| **Studio** | [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) | View and manage the Postgres database |
| **Nitro Worker (API)** | [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) | API background service and job runner |
