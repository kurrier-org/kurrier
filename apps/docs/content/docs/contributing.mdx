Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Kurrier**!

This guide walks you through setting up the full development environment, including:

- ✔ Backend stack (Postgres, Supabase services, Redis, Typesense, Worker)
- ✔ Web dashboard (Next.js)
- ✔ Tools such as Studio & Kong

If you run into any issues, feel free to open an issue or PR — contributions of all kinds are welcome.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Kurrier uses **Docker Compose** for backend services and **pnpm** for frontend apps. Start by ensuring you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)


### 🛠️ Development Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kurrier-org/kurrier.git
cd kurrier/db
cp example.develop.env .env
cp example.develop.env .env.develop
cp -r ./init/volumes/ volumes
docker compose up -d
cd ..
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### 🧭 Access the Dashboards
